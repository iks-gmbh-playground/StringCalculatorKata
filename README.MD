#Kata: String Calculator#
Before you start

- Try not to read ahead.
- Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.
- There is no need to test for invalid inputs for this kata, assume the string you receive is correctly formatted.

##Create a simple String calculator with a method: int add (string numbers)##
- The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0) for example “” or “1” or “1,2”
- Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to one and two numbers
- Remember to solve things as simply as possible
- Remember to refactor after each passing test
##Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers##
##Handle empty Strings betweeen kommas and trailing and leading blanks##
